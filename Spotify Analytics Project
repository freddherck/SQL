# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

-- Determine the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;
-- Determine who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;
-- Search which artists have more than one track in the top 50?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) AS track_count
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- What is the average danceability score of tracks by each artist?
SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;
-- Which track has the longest duration?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;
-- Which track has the highest combination score of danceability and energy, weighted by popularity?
SELECT 
    track_name, 
    artist_name,
    (danceability * 0.5 + energy * 0.5) * popularity AS weighted_score
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY weighted_score DESC
LIMIT 1;
-- Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
